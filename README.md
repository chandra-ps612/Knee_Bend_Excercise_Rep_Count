**Limitations:**


Mediapipe models (```BlazePose.Heavy```, ```BlazePose.Full```, and ```BlazePose.Lite```) work best if the person is standing 2-4 meters away from the camera and one major limitation of their model is that this approach only works for single-person pose detection, itâ€™s not applicable for multi-person detection.
